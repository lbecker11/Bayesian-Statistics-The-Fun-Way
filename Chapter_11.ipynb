    "1. One of the benefits of variance is that squaring the differences makes the penalties exponential. Give some examples of when this would be a useful property.\n",
    "    - In portfolio theory, variance is used to measure the volatility of returns. Squaring the differences means that:\n",
    "    - A few wild swings in asset prices (e.g., a stock crashing 30%) are penalized much more than a series of small fluctuations.\n",
    "    - This helps investors avoid portfolios that might look stable on average but hide dangerous outliers.\n",
    "    - Why it matters: Youâ€™d rather avoid a portfolio that occasionally tanks, even if it averages out nicely.\n"
