    "1. Suppose you're playing air hockey with some friends and flip a coin to see who starts with the puck. After playing 12 times, you realize that the friend who brings thee coin almost always seems to go first: 9 out of 12 times. Some of your other friends start to get suspicious. Define prior probability distributions for the following beliefs:\n",
    "    - One person who weakly believes that the friend is cheating and the true rate of coming up heads is closer to 70%\n",
    "    - One person whoe very strongly believes that the coin is fair and provided a 50% chance of coming heads.\n",
    "    - One person who strongly believes the coin biased to come up heads 70% percent\n"
