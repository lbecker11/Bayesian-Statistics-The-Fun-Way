How does this change the prior, and therefore the posterior odds, for our problem? Are you more willing to believe that the die being rolled is the loaded die?"

    "2. Returning to the rare disease example, suppose you go to the doctor, and after having your ears cleaned you notice that your symptoms persist. Even worse, you have a new symptom: vertigo. The doctor proposes another possible explanation, labyrinthitism which is a viral infection of the inner ear in which 98% of cases involve vertigo. However, hearing loss and tinnitus are less common in this disease; hearing loss occurs only 30% of the time, and tinnitus only occurs 28% of the time. Vertigo is also possible symptom of vestibular schwannoma, but occurs only 49% of cases. In the general population, 35 people per million contract labyrinthis annually. What is the posterior odds when you compare the hypothesis that you have labyrinthitis against the hypothesis that you vesticular schwannoma?"
